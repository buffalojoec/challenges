### Description
In this challenge your mission is to create a Solana program that can transfer SOL between two accounts!
ðŸ’¡ Record the start time so we can reference it later.
How long do you think it will take you to write this?
Good luck **${session?.user?.name}**!
1. Visit the [Solana Developer Docs](https://docs.solana.com/developers) or the [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/#contributing) for guides.
2. Write a simple HelloWorld program. You can even reference [this repository](https://docs.solana.com/getstarted/hello-world).
3. Set up a list of accounts to be passed in as a parameter.
4. Add a [Cross-Program Invocation](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs) to conduct a transfer.
5. Deploy your program to `devnet`.
ðŸ’¡ Record the end time. How long did it take?
### Tips:
- You'll need to use a **Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)** to accomplish this.
- Your sender (who's account is being debited) will need to sign this transaction.
- Your program will use three accounts: the sender, the recipient, and the System Program.
- You can use the Solana Explorer or Solscan to validate the transaction.
- You can use the CLI to validate the change in balance of two accounts.
